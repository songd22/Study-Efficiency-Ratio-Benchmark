# Study Efficiency Ratio Benchmark

A simple as-you-go benchmark to encourage efficiency and consistent breaktime. A terminal-based productivity tool that provides active feedback about work efficiency over time. Designed for accurate feedback without bloat or gamefication. Instead of displaying statistics at the end of a work session, statistics will be displayed **as one studies,** of which this information can be used to encourage productivity or provide insight into work habits. 

# Core Concept

SER, or Study/Session Efficiency Ratio, is defined as _active working time / total elapsed time_. When you take a break, your SER will decrease. Consistent working results in an increase or recovery of SER. The user sets a goal for the session and a simple delta is calculated to indicate improvement or regression.
